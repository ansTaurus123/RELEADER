This pattern is quite common with academic anxiety.\n\nLet's try a quick technique: When you feel that anxiety rising in the evening as you study, take a deliberate 2-minute pause. During this time, practice 4-7-8 breathing: inhale for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale for 8. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system, which helps counteract the stress response.\n\nWould you be willing to try this technique tonight and let me know how it affects your anxiety levels?";

Based on what you've shared, we should address both your academic stress and sleep patterns together.\n\nFor sleep specifically, I'd recommend implementing a 'wind-down' routine about an hour before bedtime. This means no studying right before sleep, limiting screen time, and perhaps trying some gentle stretching or meditation.\n\nCould you tell me a bit more about your current nighttime routine?

Would you like to work on identifying some of your specific anxiety-triggering thoughts so we can practice reframing them together?";

This will help us develop more targeted coping strategies.";
